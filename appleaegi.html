    <h2>Some Cultivars:</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Fuji:</strong>
    <br>
    The Fuji apple is an apple hybrid developed by growers at Tohoku Research Station in Fujisaki, Aomori, Japan, in the late 1930s, and brought to market in 1962.
    The thick skin of the Fuji apple is light red with a yellow blush, and is oftentimes lined with red vertical stripes.
    The Fuji's interior creamy white flesh is dense, juicy, and crisp. Low in acid, the flavor is mild yet very sweet with hints of both honey and citrus.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Gala:</strong>
    <br>
    Gala apples are covered in a thin yellow to orange skin, highlighted with pink to red stripes that vary in hue dependent upon the apples maturity.
    Their dense flesh is creamy yellow and crisp, offering a mildly sweet flavor and flora aroma.
    Gala apples ranked at number 2 in 2006 on the US Apple Association's list of most popular apples, after Red Delicious and before Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, and Fuji.

    <strong>Cripps Pink:</strong>
    <br>
    Cripps Pink apples are a particularly attractive variety of a medium to large size.
    The trees grow 30 feet high and 15 feet wide, and set beautiful fruit with a pink blush overlayed on greenish-yellow undertones.
    The flesh is firm, crisp, effervescent, and yellow-white, with a tangy and sweet flavor.
    Some have described Cripps Pink as having notes of honey.
